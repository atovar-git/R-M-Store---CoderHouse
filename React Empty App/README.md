Here you will find the steps to create this or any other React project.

### Creation üõ†Ô∏è and Run üéÆ

Follow these steps:

1. Go to a folder where you want to work. This process will create another folder inside with the name you choose.
2. Open the command prompt (cmd, bash). Run:
3. ```npx create-react-app my-app-name``` will create the folder with this name.
4. ```cd my-app-name```
5. ```npm start``` to start the application. By default, the project will be opened in port **3000** (http://localhost:3000). If it is not available will use another one. The page gets refreshed **automatically** when you make a change in the code.
6. To stop the execution, use: ```Ctrl + C```.

*Note: react project uses default port 3000. Could use another one if it is not available.*
