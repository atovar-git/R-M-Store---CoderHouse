## CoderHouse - React

This readme describes how this React app was created, and could be used for the creation of any other apps.

#  React App

Here you will find the steps to create this or any other React project.

### Creation 🛠️ and Run 🎮

Follow these steps:

1. Go to a folder where you want to work. This process will create another folder inside with the name you choose.
2. Open the command prompt (cmd, bash). Run:
3. ```npx create-react-app my-app-name``` will create the folder with this name.
4. ```cd my-app-name```
5. ```npm start``` to start the application. By default, the project will be opened in port **3000** (http://localhost:3000). If it is not available will use another one. The page gets refreshed **automatically** when you make a change in the code.
6. To stop the execution, use: ```Ctrl + C```.

*Note: react project uses default port 3000. Could use another one if it is not available.*

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
